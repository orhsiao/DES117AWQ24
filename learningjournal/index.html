            <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog/Windows</a>, I learned a few things to be aware of when using modals. First, I learned that the main reasons modals are used in web design are to catch the user’s attention, to get input needed from the user, or to show additional information that is not of immediate importance as a piece of content in the page itself. Second, I learned that all modals should contain or be made up of five different components. They should have a shadow over the main page as to bring focus to the modal while still having the main content visible. They should also have two ways for users to exit the modal: either using a close/exit button or a submit/enter button. They should also have a title to inform the users what the purpose of it is as well as be sized well in accordance with the screen size keeping in mind how it will look on mobile devices as it is advised to keep modals on the top half of the page to prevent it getting lost when viewed on mobile devices. Lastly, I learned that it is best to not have modals appear unless users have clicked a button or performed an action that prompts it. For example: when logging into or creating an account, that is an appropriate time to use modals but when entering a site, users should not be bombarded with pop up advertisements or modals asking to join their newsletter. If modals are overused, users will click out of them without even reading or caring what they are about as they become a nuisance over time. </p>

            <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, I learned a few important things to take into consideration when creating my own forms. First I learned that the spacing and distribution as well as the order of the form items is important. What I mean by this is that it is not good to put too many boxes on one portion of the form as it can look like a lot to users and deter them from wanting to fill it out. If there are any form items that are not immediately necessary it is good to have those as a “complete later” option and if there are a lot of form items that are necessary to complete the form it is good to have multiple pages and to show users how far along they are in completing the form. The order of the form is important as users are less likely to start a form if it is not convenient for them to get that information such as a credit card number or social security number but if they have already completed the previous steps and effort has been put into it they are more inclined to grab their information to complete the form since they’ve already made it so far. When spacing the form items it is better to have it in list form rather than have columns of items to fill out. This is another way users can be overwhelmed by a form which could cause them to not want to fill it out any longer.</p>
            <p>An example of this I can think of is the <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">sephora</a> website. When browsing through the website users do not even need to fill anything out. It isn’t until users want to save an item or have items in their cart be remembered that they need to sign into their account which is just a simple email address and email. When checking out the process is simple and not overwhelming. Users can also “checkout as guest” if they do not want a full blown account. The first step is confirming basket items and adding any promo codes or selecting samples. Then users are asked for a shipping address, followed by a shipping option (standard shipping being the default), followed by if the order is a gift or not, and finally payment information. As mentioned in the article, the payment information is asked for at the end as users feel more invested in the process of completing the form as opposed to if they were asked for payment information at the very beginning. Finally, the user is asked to double check the basket and confirm their order.</p>
