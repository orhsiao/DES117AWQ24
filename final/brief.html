            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>For my final project I will be updating my Studio 2 project, or the Every Picture project. I chose this project because of the feedback I got from peers about the layout and because I feel like I could do more with it.</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Version 1 of the project consists of five containers with an image and some text in each that scrolls from top to bottom for users to see the information. Because the containers needed to fit the screen individually I was limited on how large I could make them and much of the feedback I got about it was how users did not like that it was left aligned and not centered although I did that intentionally as it seemed too empty when centered.</p>
            <p>To fix that along with a few other tweaks I will reformat my site so that the containers scroll horizontally and if I have time, I will have just the images displayed with the containers as overlays when clicked. I will try to be aware of how the site will be displayed in order for users to know what to do as some feedback told me that it was not clear that they needed to hover over the image to make it full color so they did not get to see my site fully.</p>
            <p>I plan to improve the overall quality but more specifically, I will focus on design (with a touch of usability). This means I will be mainly trying to make my project look better and for it to be intuitive on what the user is meant to do with it.</p>

            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>Throughout this process I seek help from a graduate student with some form of CS background. I will try to find someone outside of the class but if I am not able to I will ask Abrar for feedback during the project.</p>
