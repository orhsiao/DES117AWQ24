                    <h2>2019 : My Baby</h2>
                    <p>My Baby was my first mantis. I found her when she was very small and watched her molt and grow wings. unfortunately she had a couple bad molts resulting in a bent thorax that lead to her early death.</p>

                    <h2>2020 : Annie</h2>
                    <p>Annie was found on a scarlet sage plant in my yard. She and another mantis were on the plant and since they are carnivourous and territorial I took her in to raise so they would not fight.</p>

                    <h2>2021 : Baby</h2>
                    <p>Baby was found in the swimming pool. I was swimming laps and I thought he was a stick but he was moving and I realized he was a mantis so I lifted him out of the water and brought him home with me. Unfortunately, I think the chlorine got to him so he died a bit sooner than expected.</p>

                    <p>BongoChongoBingoBango (BongoChongo for short) was actually found later on when she was full grown. I had found another mantis before that I raised from a very small juvenile and I brought BongoChongo in to be his mate. Unfortunately, I left them alone for too long and she ate him.</p>

                    <h2>2023 : VoidStroke</h2>
                    <p>VoidStroke was my most recent mantis. I don't remember where I found her but I took her in same as the others. My friends and I were taking the Processing coding class and so we named her VoidStroke as a joke since those were frequent words in our vocabulary during that time. She lived a complete and normal life.</p>
